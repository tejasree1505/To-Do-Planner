# To-Do-Planner
This web application, named "Taskify," is a To-Do Planner designed using HTML, CSS, and PHP. 
It offers three main sections: left for task statistics, middle for daily tasks, and right for a monthly calendar. 
Users can add tasks with various attributes like title, date, time, repeat frequency, type (personal/official), and notes. 
Completed tasks can be checked off. 
The app fetches data from a local MySQL database to dynamically display task counts and populate today's tasks. 
Its responsive design and functionality make it a versatile tool for efficient task management.
